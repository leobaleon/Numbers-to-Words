# Numbers-to-Words
This is one of the first projects I worked on when I was learning C++. The original was a sloppy mess of a function. Now it's a little bit cleaned up.

The point of this program is to allow a user to type in a positive value (ex. 1223, 17, 0, 123901283012830123, etc) when prompted and receive the US English word version back. Currently, the program does not support negative numbers or decimal values. CTRL+C to exit the program. 

The idea for this program came from my own poor memory on how to write out numbers when I would have to write a check for rent...
